When you step outside your door to a beautiful day. You wear the short running shorts and a light tanktop.

And you didn't look at the forecast for when you return! Snow, rain, wind, dust. 

Now, leave the decisions up to the Application. You concentrate on your training. You'll know what extra piece of clothing to bring.
